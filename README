This is your git respository.  You are
initially on branch "master".  
This branch is where you will turn in your assignments.

There is nothing here right now because
we distribute your assignments on branch "dist".

First, make sure you are up to date, and merge
in changes from dist

 git pull origin dist


Now, do work.  When you want to add a file
to git, do 

 git add filename

when you want to commit

 git commit

when you want to push (submit work)

 git push

You can tell what is and is not committed with

 git status
