I pushed files to your repository while you were working
on step 1.  By pulling you got them.

Now let's edit this file in emacs.

First, open the file in emacs:

  emacs -nw step2.txt

Now, move the "point" (your cursor) down 
to the line below:

 Hello My Name Is:  <put your name here>

and edit it with your name.

Now, save (C-x C-s): that means control-x control-s
and quit C-x C-c.

Once you have quit, do 

 git status

see how this has modifications?

Now do 

 git add step2.txt

When you do 
 
 git status

again, you can see it is staged for commit.
Now do

 git commit

to commit it.  You will need to edit the
commit message, save, and quit (remember
all those from above?)

Now, do 

 git push

to turn it in.
