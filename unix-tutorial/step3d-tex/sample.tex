An Example Document\\

This is a sample \LaTeX document to give you a simple example to work from.
While this document just has simple formatting, such as \textbf{boldface} and
\emph{emphasized (italics)} text, \LaTeX can do some very complex things\footnote{
If you are very skilled in \LaTeX, you can do pretty much anything you can imagine.}.

You can turn this document into a pdf with the command \verb+pdflatex sample.tex+---which
``compiles'' the \LaTeX source into a pdf.  Once you do that, you might use \verb+scp+
to copy the resulting pdf to your own computer.  We'll note that if your working
from a computer that runs X (Linux, or Mac OSX if you have installed it), then you can
actually run graphical programs remotely, but the exported display will be rather slow
unless you have a low latency connection to the server running the program.
