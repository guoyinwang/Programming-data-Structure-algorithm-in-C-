Classwork 4, Problem 2
-----------------------

Do problem 7.6 in AoP:

Write a recursive function unsigned power(unsigned x, unsigned y) which computes xy. Write a main function which tests it with several values and convince yourself it is correct.

Save it into a file called power.c

You MUST use recursion (no iteration).
