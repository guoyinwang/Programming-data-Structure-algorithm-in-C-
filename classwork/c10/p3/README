Instead of a 3rd and 4th problem, you have a chance here to catch up 
on things you may be behind on, and to have any one classwork regraded.

Create a file called regrade.txt which has one line containing the name
of a classwork you want regraded, for example, it might say

c05

This classwork will be regraded ONE time after c10's final grading.
