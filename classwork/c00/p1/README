This classwork is to get you started with the basics.
Generally, there will be 4 problems (p1, p2, p3, and p4).

For this particular classwork, however, you are going to 
be making sure you have the basic mechanics of getting
and submitting classworks, as well as working
with a partner on an algorithms activity.

Here is what you need to do:

 (1) Find a partner.  
 (2) One of you should do problem 1.7 from AoP [page 20]
     The other should do problem 1.8 from AoP  [page 21]
 (3) Notice that step [3] of each problem asks
     you to give your algorithm to your partner.  When
     you both finish writing your algorithm and
     executing it for N=6, swap with your partner. 
     Execute your partner's algorithm and compare
     answers.
     Did you get the same answers?  Was
     something ambiguous in the algorithm?
     Did you find the patterns correctly?

 (4) After you finish, create a file in this
     director called "done.txt" and write

Yes, we did this!

     in that file.  Save it, add it to git:

git add done.txt
 
    Commit it:

git commit 
   
    [Write and save your commit message].
    Push to turn your classwork in

git push

   You should get a message which looks like this:

Counting objects: 10, done.
Delta compression using up to 2 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (6/6), done.
Writing objects: 100% (6/6), 791 bytes, done.
Total 6 (delta 3), reused 0 (delta 0)
Unpacking objects: 100% (6/6), done.

   2830ea5..49716b9  master -> master

The specific details may vary, but   master -> master means
you pushed yoru changes to the master branch, which is
what we grade.

If you run
    git status

You will get a message describing what is and is not
up to date.  If it looks like this, everything is
submitted:

   # On branch master
   nothing to commit (working directory clean)

If it looks like this:

  # On branch master
  # Untracked files:
  #   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)  
  # 
  #	something.txt
  nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

you have files git does nto know about.  This may be fine (if you don't
want to turn them in), or you may want to add them.

If it looks like this:

  # On branch master
  # Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit.
  #
  nothing to commit (working directory clean)

You have commited your changes, but not pushed them (they aren't turned in).
