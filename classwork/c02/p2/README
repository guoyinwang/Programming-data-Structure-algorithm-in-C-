Classwork 2: Problem 2
----------------------

 1. Open the file "squares.c". Inside this file,
    you will find that I have already done steps 1--4
    for an algorithm which draws two (possibly overlapping)
    squares (one of #s and one of *s). 

 2. Read the generalized steps that I have written as comments
    in this file.  Note that whenever I indicate a range
    (count from x to y, or between x and y), the range is 
    inclusive of the lower bound, and exclusive of the upper bound.
    All counting is "count up by one."  Determine if there are
    any parts of these steps that you will want to abstract
    out into a separate function.

 3. Implement this algorithm by translating my steps into code.
    You may abstract any pieces you want out into separate functions.
    If you do so, write these new functions above the "squares" function
    when you finish translating it.

 4. Commit your modified squares.c file with git.
