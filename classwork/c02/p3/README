Classwork 2, Problem 3:
=======================

After completing problem 2, find a partner who has also finished p2.
Swap code with your partner, and scrutinize each other's code for syntax
errors (things that are not how you learned to write them in chapter 2 of
AoP), or incorrect translations of the algorithm to code.  Help
each your partner fix his/her code.    As you work through this, you
are encouraged to ask each other questions (why did you write this
for this step?).

Note that this excercise is not only intended to help you and your
partner correct errors in the code you wrote, but is also an important
skill in itself: in a professional context, engineers often conduct
code reviews of peer's code.
